# ACED Role Based Access Control

## Use case

There are several institutions that are contributing data to ACED. Each institution has a different set of data access policies. 
Each may have different requirements for how data is accessed, and who can access it. 
Importantly, each institution may have individual who approves access to data.

## Solution

We use Gen3's role based access control (RBAC) to manage access to data.

* There is a separate `program` resource for each institution:
  * /programs/ohsu
  * /programs/stanford
  * /programs/ucl
  * /programs/manchester

* There is a separate requestor `policy` for each program. "Update" in this context means setting the status of a user's request to [SIGNED].
  * ohsu_requestor_updater_role
  * stanford_requestor_updater_role
  * ucl_requestor_updater_role
  * manchester_requestor_updater_role

Since this approach relies on Gen3's [Requestor](https://github.com/uc-cdis/requestor/blob/master/docs/functionality_and_flow.md#example-backend-flow) for all assignments of policies to users we get  the following benefits:
* Tooling (command line for now, web page in the future) leverages requestor API
* Auditing of data access requests is done by requestor

## Implementation

### Adding Data Access Committee members

Note: This example uses the ohsu program, but the same process applies to all programs.

* A sysadmin will add the ohsu_requestor_updater_role  to a data-access-committee member(s)
* Only users with the ohsu_requestor_updater_role  can APPROVE and SIGN adding policies

```text
#  sysadmin adds role to user
gen3_util access touch <data-access-committee>@ohsu.edu /programs/ohsu --roles ohsu_requestor_updater_role
#  sysadmin SIGNs the request
gen3_util access <request-ids> SIGNED
```

### Creating a new project

* Any user may request a project be added to the institution's program.
* The user who requested the project is automatically given the read and write roles.
 
```text
# add requestor read and write policies to resource /programs/ohsu/projects/test
gen3_util projects add resource ohsu-test
```

* Ony user's with the ohsu_requestor_updater_role  can approve and sign a request

```text
gen3_util access <request-ids> SIGNED
```

### Adding a new user to a project

* Any user may request a user be added to a project.
* The `--write` flag will grant the user write access to the project.
 
```text
# add requestor read and write policies to resource /programs/ohsu/projects/test
gen3_util projects add user user@example.com ohsu-test
```

* Ony user's with the ohsu_requestor_updater_role  can approve and sign a request

```text
gen3_util access <request-ids> SIGNED
```
